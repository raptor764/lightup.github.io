      <h2>Light Up Game Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Light Up is played on a rectangular grid of cells. You need to place
        light bulbs in empty cells such that no two bulbs shine on each other,
        until the entire grid is lit up. A bulb sends rays of light horizontally
        and vertically, illuminating its entire row and column unless its light
        is blocked by a wall cell. A wall cell may have a number on it from 0 to
        4, indicating how many bulbs must be placed adjacent to its four sides;
        for example, a cell with a 4 must have four bulbs around it, one on each
        side, and a cell with a 0 cannot have a bulb next to any of its sides.
        An unnumbered wall cell may have any number of light bulbs adjacent to
        it, or none. Bulbs placed diagonally adjacent to a numbered cell do not
        contribute to the bulb count.
